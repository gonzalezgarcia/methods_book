We’ll begin by introducing key concepts in research methods and experimental thinking, providing you with a solid theoretical foundation. Then, we’ll dive into hands-on training using OpenSesame, a Python-based software for creating psychology experiments.\nBy the end of these weeks of class, you will be able to:\nThis guide is designed to be both theoretical and practical. Most of the chapters include conceptual discussions followed by hands-on exercises to help you apply what you’ve learned.

The task will require participants to press a specific key based on whether they think the displayed string is a word or non-word.\n\nFixed vs. Varying Properties\nTo understand how E-Prime works, a key concept to always keep in mind is the distinction between fixed and varying properties in an experiment: - Fixed properties: Elements like the fixation display (e.g., position, color, duration) will remain the same across trials. - Varying properties: The actual words and correct responses will change with each trial.\nIf we define which properties remain constant and which vary across trials when designing each event, it will be easir to understand which information goes into a procedure and what goes into a list.",

How does this affect the flexibility and scalability of your experimental design?\nWhy is it important to balance the number of trials across conditions, and what issues could arise if this balance is not maintained?\n\n\n\nFeedback in Cognitive Tasks\n\nHow does adding feedback in a cognitive task, particularly in a practice block, help participants perform better in the actual trials? What are the potential downsides of providing feedback in all blocks?\nReflect on the role of feedback in learning and task performance. Should feedback always be included in experiments, or are there scenarios where it might interfere with data collection?\n\n\n\nCounterbalancing and Bias\n\nWhy is counterbalancing critical in cognitive tasks, such as the lexical decision task or the Flanker task? What would be the consequences of failing to counterbalance responses across participants?\nHow does counterbalancing responses improve the internal validity of an experiment? Can counterbalancing introduce any unintended complexities in data analysis?\n\n\n\nThe Flanker Task\n\nIn the context of the Flanker task, how does the proportion of congruent versus incongruent trials affect response inhibition? Why might a higher proportion of incongruent trials make it easier for participants to control inappropriate responses?\nReflect on how varying the proportion of congruent and incongruent trials could affect the interpretation of reaction time (RT) and accuracy (ACC) results. How might these effects differ across participants with varying cognitive control abilities?\n\n\n\nExperimental Controls and Variability\n\nWhat are some potential challenges in designing experiments with both within-participants and between-participants factors, as seen in the Flanker task? How can you minimize participant variability while maintaining the experimental design’s integrity?\nWhy is it important to control for the sequence and timing of stimuli presentation, and how do randomization and counterbalancing help address these issues?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you can find the slides from this session:",

What are the benefits of using this object to track accuracy?\nIf a participant is consistently below the 80% accuracy threshold, what steps could you take to adapt the experiment and improve their performance? Reflect on how accuracy thresholds can be implemented using the Summation object.\n\n\n\nDebugging and Code Testing\n\nHow does the use of Debug.Print assist in testing and troubleshooting your experiment? Why is it useful to check the state of variables like TrialCounter while running the program?\nReflect on the importance of continuous debugging during the development of a complex experiment. What strategies can you use to ensure that errors are caught and corrected early?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you can find the slides from this session:",

We’ll begin by introducing key concepts in research methods and experimental thinking, providing you with a solid theoretical foundation. Then, we’ll dive into hands-on training using E-Prime and OpenSesame, two powerful pieces of software for creating psychology experiments.\nBy the end of this module, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand and apply principles of experimental design in cognitive neuroscience\nThink critically about research methodology and experimental control\nDesign and program your own experiments using E-Prime and OpenSesame\nTroubleshoot common issues in experiment programming\n\nThis guide is designed to be both theoretical and practical. Most of the chapters include conceptual discussions followed by hands-on exercises to help you apply what you’ve learned. Remember, mastering these skills requires practice, creativity, and persistence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\n\n\nCourse guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThis material has been elaborated for the use of the Cognitive Neuroscience master students of the Universidad de Granada, years 2023-25.\nThe resources listed here are Open Educational Resources (OER) that are free to use, share, copy, and edit, with attribution, following the terms of the specified license.\nPlease contact Carlos González for any inquiry."

    "text": "From Research Questions to Data\nThe essence of cognitive neuroscience experiments is to examine relationships between manipulations (independent variables) and their effects on measurable outcomes (dependent variables). Remember there are various experimental designs, such as:\n\nBetween-participants design: Each participant experiences only one level of a factor.\nWithin-participants design: Participants experience multiple levels of a factor, allowing for within-subject comparisons.\nMixed designs: Combining elements of both between- and within-participant designs.\n\nThere are also techniques like counterbalancing to mitigate order effects and ensure reliable, replicable results."

Understanding Experimental Design\n\nWhat are the key differences between between-participants and within-participants designs, and in what scenarios would you prefer one over the other?\nReflect on the importance of counterbalancing in experimental design. How does it help improve the reliability of an experiment?\n\n\n\n2. From Research Questions to Experiment Design\n\nHow would you approach transforming a cognitive neuroscience research question into a concrete experimental procedure? What are the key stages you must consider?\nHow do repeated measures (within-participant designs) affect the interpretation of experimental data compared to between-participant designs?\n\n\n\n3. Programming and Tools\n\nCompare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of E-Prime and OpenSesame. How might the choice of tool affect the design and execution of your experiment?\nIn programming an experiment, why is it important to understand both the user interface (e.g., E-Prime’s E-Studio) and coding components (e.g., Inline Scripts)?\n\n\n\n4. Ethical Considerations\n\nWhen designing experiments in cognitive neuroscience, what ethical considerations should be taken into account? How can these be incorporated into the design phase?\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow, you can find the slides from this session:"

    "section": "Developing a Lexical Decision Task",
    "text": "Developing a Lexical Decision Task\nIn this session, we’ll create a lexical decision task, where participants must determine whether a string of letters is a word or a non-word. The task will consist of several trials, each with the following sequence:\n\nFixation: Displayed for 1000ms\n\nProbe: Displayed for 2000ms\n\nFor each trial, the word will either be a real word (e.g., “cat”) or a non-word (e.g., “jop”). The task will require participants to press a specific key based on whether they think the displayed string is a word or non-word.\n\nFixed vs. Varying Properties\nTo understand how E-Prime works, a key concept to always keep in mind is the distinction between fixed and varying properties in an experiment: - Fixed properties: Elements like the fixation display (e.g., position, color, duration) will remain the same across trials. - Varying properties: The actual words and correct responses will change with each trial.\nIf we define which properties remain constant and which vary across trials when designing each event, it will be easir to understand which information goes into a procedure and what goes into a list."

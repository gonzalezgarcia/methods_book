    "text": "Welcome\n\n\n\nAI algorithm hallucinates what this course is about\n\n\nThis text is aimed to serve as your guide for the first half of the course “Methodology in Cognitive Neuroscience: Basic and Applied Research” in the Master’s Program in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Granada.\nIn this section, we will explore the foundations of experimental research in cognitive neuroscience and develop practical skills in experiment programming. We’ll begin by introducing key concepts in research methods and experimental thinking, providing you with a solid theoretical foundation. Then, we’ll dive into hands-on training using E-Prime and OpenSesame, two powerful pieces of software for creating psychology experiments.\nBy the end of this module, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand and apply principles of experimental design in cognitive neuroscience\nThink critically about research methodology and experimental control\nDesign and program your own experiments using E-Prime and OpenSesame\nTroubleshoot common issues in experiment programming\n\nThis guide is designed to be both theoretical and practical. Most of the chapters include conceptual discussions followed by hands-on exercises to help you apply what you’ve learned. Remember, mastering these skills requires practice, creativity, and persistence!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\n\n\nCourse guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThis material has been elaborated for the use of the Cognitive Neuroscience master students of the Universidad de Granada, years 2023-25.\nThe resources listed here are Open Educational Resources (OER) that are free to use, share, copy, and edit, with attribution, following the terms of the specified license.\nPlease contact Carlos González for any inquiry."

    "text": "From Research Questions to Data\nThe essence of cognitive neuroscience experiments is to examine relationships between manipulations (independent variables) and their effects on measurable outcomes (dependent variables). Remember there are various experimental designs, such as:\n\nBetween-participants design: Each participant experiences only one level of a factor.\nWithin-participants design: Participants experience multiple levels of a factor, allowing for within-subject comparisons.\nMixed designs: Combining elements of both between- and within-participant designs.\n\nThere are also techniques like counterbalancing to mitigate order effects and ensure reliable, replicable results."

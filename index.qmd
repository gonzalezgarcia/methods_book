<!-- ![AI algorithm hallucinates what this course is about](/chatgpt.png){width=500} -->

This text is aimed to serve as your guide for the first half of the 2025/26 course **Methodology in Cognitive Neuroscience: Basic and Applied Research** in the Master's Program in Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Granada.

In this part of the course, we will explore the foundations of experimental research in cognitive neuroscience and develop practical skills in experiment programming. We'll begin by introducing key concepts in research methods and experimental thinking, providing you with a solid theoretical foundation. Then, we'll dive into hands-on training using [**OpenSesame**](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/), a Python-based software for creating psychology experiments.

By the end of these weeks of class, you will be able to:

- Understand and apply principles of experimental design in cognitive neuroscience
- Think critically about research methodology and experimental control
- Understand and write basic Python code
- Design and program your own experiments using OpenSesame

This guide is designed to be both theoretical and practical. Most of the chapters include conceptual discussions followed by hands-on exercises to help you apply what you've learned. Remember, mastering these skills requires practice, creativity, and persistence!

## Course Organization

### Schedule and syllabus

Classes will take place on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, from 09:00 to 10:30 and from 15:00 to 16:30, respectively. All classes will be held in Seminario 3 of the CIMCYC.

This part of the course will run from October 7 to October 29, 2025, and we will have an exam on October 31, 2025.

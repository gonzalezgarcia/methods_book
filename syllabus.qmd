## Course Policies

### Attendance and Participation

Attendance is strongly encouraged for this course due to its eminently practical nature. Please note:

- Many in-class activities and hands-on exercises might not be easily replicated outside of class.
- Regular attendance will significantly enhance your learning experience and ability to complete assignments successfully.
- If you must miss a class, it is your responsibility to catch up on missed material and assignments.
- Consistent participation in class discussions and activities will positively impact your learning and final grade.

### Late Work and Extensions

- Assignments are due on the dates specified in the course schedule.
- Late submissions will incur a 20% penalty
- If you anticipate difficulty meeting a deadline, please contact me as soon as possible to discuss potential extensions.
- Extensions may be granted for documented emergencies or extenuating circumstances at the instructor's discretion.

### Academic Integrity

- All work submitted must be your own.
- When using external sources (including generative AI tools), proper citation is required.
- Collaboration on assignments is encouraged, but each student must submit their own original work.

### Communication

- Email (`cgonzalez at ugr dot es`) is the primary mode of communication outside of class.
- You can also use PRADO if you prefer.

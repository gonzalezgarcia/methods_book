# Reflections and Feedback {.unnumbered}


This session provides an overview of student feedback on the **Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience** course. We also explore suggestions for improvements in teaching and course structure.

### Key Learning Points from Feedback

Students noted strengths and areas for improvement, which are summarized below:

**Positive**:

   - Task clarity and organization were appreciated.
   - Hands-on practice with E-Prime, OpenSesame, as well as Python
   - Understanding the “why” behind the task design choices.


**Challenges**:

  - Difficulty in balancing task coding with conceptual learning.
  - Transition between OpenSesame and E-Prime was challenging due to time constraints.



## Student Suggestions for Course Improvement
Based on collected feedback, here are suggestions for enhancing the learning experience:

1. **Focusing on a Single Software**:
   - Many students suggested concentrating on **OpenSesame** or another single platform (e.g., **PsychoPy**) to streamline the learning curve.
   - This would allow more in-depth exploration of coding and experimental design.

2. **More Emphasis on Coding Basics**:
   - Introducing coding with structured, step-by-step tutorials.
   - Allocating dedicated sessions solely for coding practice would enhance proficiency.

3. **Improving Task Clarity with Additional Resources**:
   - **Video Tutorials**: Recording sessions or providing video walkthroughs of tasks could help students revisit complex topics.
   - **Supplementary Reading**: Curated lists of online tutorials or articles on experimental design would aid independent study.

4. **Increasing Emphasis on Experimental Design**:
   - While coding is essential, more context around why certain designs are chosen and how they relate to research questions would benefit overall understanding.



## Reflection and Plans for Next Year

In light of this feedback, the following changes are being considered for course 2025/26:

1. **Dedicated Coding Sessions**:
   - Allocating specific days for coding practice will provide more time for skill development.

2. **Software Focus**:
   - Based on student preference, OpenSesame might be the primary tool, with reduced emphasis on E-Prime.
  
3. **Enhanced Task Explanations**:
   - Adding detailed rationales for task design choices to improve understanding of the research context behind each experiment.
